My Project Name
STRANDED-GAME

Project description
A game first hand shooter game. player begins on an island and must find objects to fix spaceship, once ship is fixed they can leave the island and explore the universe to find answers as to why they are stranded 

 The user wake up on the island. I would like the player to use their own initive I will add prompts when they interact with certain objects

Goals for Version 1
Be able to have a island that the player can intereact with and collect objects, once completed collection it will peomt the ship to start up this can be done with if , else , etc 

The simpilist version of project will be character walking around and physiscs is correct so player isnt falling through the floor 

Libraries / Other Technology Needed
Unreal, Megascans, Marvelous Designer, iClone, blender  

I will use Youtube to help me build sufficent librarys and assets 

Risks
physics not working properly really need to work on collisons and mark out no go zones to keep player from going to far, working out correct sizing for landscape. be able to get the inventory to work and setting up correct conditional statements for item collection, inventory and ship activation.
